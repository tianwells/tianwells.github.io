title: Week 5

This week we worked on finalizing everything we need to do pilot testing. I worked primarily on fixing the delay in all of the caption error video clips, which took some time because I had to get used to using the CADET software. We also made some changes to our flyer and to our pre and post questions, in order to get everything more ready and move forward with our experiment. Since this week was shorter, I only got done with a few delay fixes, but I feel confident that I can fix many more much quicker in the future. Next week I plan to fix all of the rest of the delays and run the pilot study, as well as finish up our presentation.
