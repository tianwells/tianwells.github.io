This week I worked a lot on summarizing and presenting our research. I went on a wild goose chase to find the 17 weighted errors of WWER, but they weren’t anywhere on the internet. Hopefully NCAM gets back to us next week so that we can use WWER in our experiment. I also helped out with our presentation, and I felt that it went pretty well for us. What has taken most of my time has been sifting through all the information we found in our literature review, and organizing it in a way that makes sense for our typed literature review background. It has been challenging but rewarding to write all our research out in a way that is presentable and nice. My goal is that eventually the background information we write out makes sense and sounds very scholarly. Next week, I’ll finish that up first, and then work on writing out a descriptive methods plan for our experiment. I also want to help write a code that will evaluate all our videos’ caption metrics, and see which metrics the most skewed ratio. Those videos will be the most interesting to test, because they’ll show which metric is more accurate the most clearly.
