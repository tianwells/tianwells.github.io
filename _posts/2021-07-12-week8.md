title: Week 8

I worked on recruiting participants for our study this week, and ran a few tests. I found participants from friends and friends of friends. I also posted in more Facebook groups. We also determined that we would need to change our experiment and throw away our last four tests. Luckily we were able to change the captions on the Youtube videos without having to re upload any videos. Next week I look forward to scheduling even more studies.
