title: Week 7

This past week, I helped to create a new version of our experiment. Our pilot studies had been going well, but one pilot study participant suggested that we embed our videos into a survey instead of showing the videos one at a time and collecting data through a repeating survey after each video. I spent a lot of time looking at different survey websites, and determining if any would work for us. At first, I built a survey on SurveyMonkey, but I then found out that Survey Monkey requires that you sign up for a paid plan. We had to scrap that, but then I realized that our videos could be input into the google form, we just needed to do it through YouTube. The downside is that you need to navigate away from the google form in order to watch the video in fullscreen on YouTube, but the upside is that itâ€™s free and easily added onto our existing survey! We ran some actual studies using the new survey, and they all went well. However, we realized that the error and accurate captions are different in style to the point where it may skew our results. Next week we need to determine what to do about this and if we need to restart our stimuli clips.
