title: Week 9
---
This week we got 7 new participants which is good progress! All of our meetings with participants so far have been good and without problems. We noticed that the responses for question 3 were odd. Question 3 asked participants to rate the quality of the error clip after they watched both the error and accurate clips, so we expected quality ratings to decrease as participants recognized more errors. It was actually the opposite, as participants gave number 3 relatively high numbers. We think that the question may have been unclearly worded, and participants were rating the accurate clip instead of the error clip. So the bad news of this week is that we wonâ€™t be able to use the data from question three.
