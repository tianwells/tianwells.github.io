title: Week 6
---
This week was a lot for me, especially because I also moved back from NY to California on Tuesday. I worked on fixing the delay in all of the rest of the videos, and that took a few iterations of edits. I helped out with our methods presentation on Thursday, and I felt we did pretty well. We were a little behind on getting our pilot testing ready, but we finally were able to today on Friday. Our pilot testing went well, we tested with both a hearing and a deaf participant. We got some feedback regarding the clarity of instructions, which was helpful. We also both realized that our captions were not the most up to date and we needed to redownload them from Google Drive. Next week, I’m looking forward to starting our actual testing if we have people signed up and ready by then. We’re also planning to do another pilot test before that, which should go pretty smoothly.
