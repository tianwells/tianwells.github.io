This last week was extremely busy! At the beginning of the week I ran two final tests. At the same time I started analyzing our data that we already had. We organized all of the data by participant first, then we created google sheets to calculate the correlations for the data and the averages. It all took a while to figure out and to get all the data in the same format. After we finished the last test, we finally input all of the participant data and created the graphs that would be used for our poster, presentation, and paper. I worked on writing our paper, helped make our poster, and helped make our presentation on Wednesday. After the presentation on Wednesday the last step was to do the finishing touches on our paper. The internship all finished up so fast it’s weird to think that it’s over! I’m so grateful for this experience, I really liked learning about caption metrics and about how to research for the first time.
